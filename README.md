CEG Tech Forum - Techops Student Director Recruitment 2023-24

## Task #1 - Backend Development

Get your hands dirty (try not to use any wrapper modules like passport) and create a web application
with simple sign-up, sign-in functionality.
● Sign-up must have email confirmation feature
● Forgot password feature using email as recovery
● Two factor authentication (do not use SMS) - Think of and create a simple authenticator.
○ Example: Via WhatsApp / Telegram / Google’s 2FA. (Anything other than SMS)
○ Race conditions are to be avoided, i.e. only one user can login at a time, and only one
session must be active.

● Provide documentation for all the API routes with all necessary details.
● Push your code and documentation (or doc links) to GitHub/GitLab.

For the above task, I have made this UI to utilize the REST API which I made using Express JS
